* Overview
Later this semester, you will be doing a number of labs and projects that are a collection of objects. Such
as a linked list of objects, stack of objects, queue of objects, tree of objects. Some of the projects will be
to maintain a ‘collection’ of objects where you will interact with the user to add, update, and delete
from the ‘collection’ of objects.

Although you will need to test your collection with a specific class from the instructor, you can use it
with a class of your own choosing.

For this Project, you are to create your own class as long as it isn’t a class that the instructor has
provided in the Demo Files or written by the instructor in class or any other class assigned. [ For
example: cannot be: Album, Artist, Car, Card, Cheese, Circle, Coin, Course, Cube, Food, Instructor, Pay,
Pizza, Rectangle, Song, TextBook, Trip, Truck, Vehicle. It also can’t be “inappropriate” such as Butt. ]

The class you create
- must have 2 private attributes of which at least one is a String and one is a numeric (int or
double)

(too many attributes ( > 3 ) is just busy work for yourself...It would be easier for future
labs/projects if the 2 attributes can uniquely identify an object)

- you need at least 1 constructor that will receive 2 parameters (to uniquely identify a specific
object)

o you can have a no-arg constructor and you can have additional constructors, but some
of the other labs/projects will require you to instantiate a unique object with
parameters

- You need setters and getters for each of the fields where applicable
[ Example: the Car class has a getSpeed() but doesn’t have a setSpeed() - it has brake() and
accelerate() both which affect speed ]

- Later in the semester, you will add the following additional methods to the class:
- equals( )
- compareTo( )
- if either of the prior methods are submitted as part of Project 1, they will be peeked at
but only graded in terms of indenting, variable names, javadoc
